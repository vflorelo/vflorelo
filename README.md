Hi!

Iâ€™m Vic Flores (@vflorelo in [every platform](https://linktr.ee/vflorelo))

I'm  a bioinformatician at [University of Cambridge](http://www.wallercellevolution.com/current/), trainer at [Cambridge Bioinformatics Training](https://bioinfotraining.bio.cam.ac.uk/staff/victor-flores-lopez) and co-founder of [ATG](https://www.atglabs.org/)

I like running, cycling, hiking, teaching, programming, and occassionally doing research

My favourite languages are bash and javascript, but whatever language gets the job done is good enough (yes, even R)

Feel free to drop me a [message](mailto:vflorelo@gmail.com)

Happy coding!
